AGENT_SAKSHI_ADDRESS = "agent1q..."  # Generated address  
AGENT_PARTH_ADDRESS = "agent1q..."   # Generated address

# Send messages to agents using uAgent protocols
from uagents_core.contrib.protocols.chat import ChatMessage, TextContent

# Example: Send a message to Agent-Devam
message = ChatMessage(
    timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
    msg_id=str(int(time.time() * 1000)),
    content=[TextContent(type="text", text="I need peace and guidance")]
)
